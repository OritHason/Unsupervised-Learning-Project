## üîß Setup and Execution Guide

Dear professor Yoram Louzoun,

Thank you for reviewing our project. 

To ensure that all required Python packages are installed and the relevant analysis runs smoothly (including saving graphs and computed outputs), please follow the simple instructions below.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

### Step 1: Locate the `setup.bat` file

1. Navigate to the root folder of the project.
2. Locate the file named: `setup.bat`.

### Step 2: Double-click the file

- Simply **double-click** on the `setup.bat` file.
- This will trigger a script that:
  - Automatically installs all required Python packages via `pip`.
  - Runs the main Python code file(s).
  - Saves any generated **graphs**, **data**, or **calculations** to the appropriate output folders.

---

## üìÇ Output

- All resulting graphs will be saved to the `Figures/` folder.
- All resulting tabels will be saved to the `generic/Statistics/` folder.

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Troubleshooting

- If double-clicking does not work, you may run the file manually:
  1. Open a Command Prompt (`cmd`) in the project directory.
  2. Run the command:  
     ```
     setup.bat
     ```

Thank you

Alon & Orit
